This is a JavaScript project created for a Udemy tutorial titled [Modern JavaScript, The Complete Course: Build 10+ Projects](https://www.udemy.com/modern-javascript-the-complete-course-build-10-projects/learn/v4/content). These files also exist in a course repository; I have copied them to their own repository so I can create a GitHub page and add it to my portfolio.
